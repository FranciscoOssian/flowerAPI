# flowerAPI 🌼🌸❀✿🌷
mini mini mini Machine Learning API that get a link of image in query params and return a flower information of image (if image cotains a flower that the machine trained). Build with <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/?hl=pt-br">TensorFlow</a> and Keras for the ML, and python for the API environmental.

# 📋 How get this model
## Google Colab step-by-tep
You can make the step-by-step to get this model, go to this (<a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1l1aT7S3yPGAZbIH87M65qDIBbiM5_8S2?usp=sharing">link</a>). Just mount your drive with this colab, run it and you will have this model in yout drive.
## Download model.h5
Or just download this .h5 (that is the model hosted in google drive) (<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IJc5hDEo0JhOX5MsOnAB35dKLng5Lr6r/view?usp=sharing">link</a>)

# 👨‍💻 Getting started
Clone this repo, put the model file in root folder with name `model.h5` (heras extension) and run the main.py

# This project its just a teste for another project involving Machine Lerarning and content moderation for a App.
